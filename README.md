# Angular.JS Course - Team Management Solution

This project represents a basic team-management software.

## Making it work

Node.JS 4.x is required to run this app.

Once the repository has been cloned just run:

```
npm install
```

The project is preconfigured with a web server and `grunt` tasks.

To run grunt tasks you need the Grunt command line interface.

Install this globally and you'll have access to the grunt command anywhere on your system.
```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

When NPM finishes fetching its modules, execute:

```
grunt up
```

That will compile all files and run the server at port 8080. You will be able to [access the application](http://localhost:8080/).
